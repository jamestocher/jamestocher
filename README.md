# **Hi there!** ðŸ‘‹
## I'm James, and this is my GitHub profile. Over the next few months, I'll be working on filling it with <sub>awesome</sub> coding projects on my quest to become an AI Engineer!
## I've already got some skills in Max/MSP and Pure Data, but I'll be developing my python skills, as well as brushing up on lots of maths!
